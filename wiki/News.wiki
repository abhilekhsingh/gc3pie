#summary User-visible changes in GC3Utils and GC3Libs


  * GC3Utils and GC3Apps (grosetta/ggamess/etc.) now all accept a 
    `-s`/`--session` option for locating the job storage directory: 
    this allows grouping jobs into folders instead of shoveling 
    them all into `~/.gc3/jobs`.
  * Renamed configuration file to `gc3pie.conf`.
  * Removed `-l` option from `gstat`.


== 0.10 ==

  * First release for public use outside of GC3
