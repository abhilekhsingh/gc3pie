#summary User-visible changes in GC3Utils and GC3Libs


== 1.1 ==

=== Configuration file changes ===

* The `architecture` value is now required for every resource.


== 1.0 ==

=== Configuration file changes ===

  * Renamed configuration file to `gc3pie.conf`: the file `gc3utils.conf` will no longer be read!
  * SGE clusters must now have `type = sge` in the configuration file (instead of `type = ssh-sge`)
  * Probably more changes than it's worth to list here: check your configuration against the ConfigurationFile wiki page!

=== Command-line utilities changes ===

  * GC3Utils and GC3Apps (grosetta/ggamess/etc.) now all accept a `-s`/`--session` option for locating the job storage directory: this allows grouping jobs into folders instead of shoveling them all into `~/.gc3/jobs`.
  * Command `gstat` will now print a summary of the job states if the list is too long to fit on screen; use the `-v` option to get the full job listing regardless of its length.
  * Command `gstat` can now print information on jobs in a certain state only; see help text for option `--state`
  * Removed `-l` option from `ginfo`; use `-v` instead.


== 0.10 ==

  * First release for public use outside of GC3
