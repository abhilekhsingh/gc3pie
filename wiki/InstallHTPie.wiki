= HTPie installation instructions =

It is recommended that you use python version 2.6, although it should work on 2.5 and 2.7 as well.

 * Download the code from the svn
 * Manually install the [http://www.graphviz.org/ Graphviz] library
 * mkdir ~/.htpie and cp etc/htpie.conf.example ~/.htpie/htpie.conf
 * Run 'setup.py install' to install the software globally

== External Dependencies ==
 * Required
  * Must be installed by user
   * [http://www.graphviz.org/ Graphviz] is used to render the state machine diagrams (sudo apt-get install libgraphviz-dev)
   * Python development files (sudo apt-get install python-dev)
   * [https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/download.html#download-and-install ASE] Atomic simulation environment
  * Automatically installed through pypi
   * [http://networkx.lanl.gov/pygraphviz/ PyGraph] is used to generate the state machine diagrams
   * [http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/ Pyparsing] is an easy to use text parser
   * [http://mongoengine.org/ MongoEngine] used to interface to the database
   * [http://code.google.com/p/argparse/ argparse] command line paring library
   * [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ConcurrentLogHandler ConcurrentLogHandler] multi-thread safe filelogger
   * [http://numpy.scipy.org/ numpy] is used for numerics. It doesn't always install through pypi well, you might have to manually install it (sudo apt-get install python-numpy)

= Notes =

 * monbodb is bound to an ip, so in your config file you need specifiy the same IP that is in mongodb.conf (check later: is it possible to have multiple ips, wildcards, or non-ip hostnames)
 * configfile: security is not really handled right now.  if you want different users to have access to the same mongodb instance, each should great their own database 
 * need pymongo 1.9
 * testing that it works:
