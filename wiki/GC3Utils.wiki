[[PageOutline]]


== Introduction ==
The gc3utils is a suite of Python classes to aid in submitting batch jobs to various cluster & grid resources seamlessly.

Most of the time a user has lots of different accounts on lots of different resources.  The idea is that a user can their jobs from one place with a few simple commands.

== Design points ==
 * The user should be able to run everything out of their own home directory.  No admin interference needed.
 * A "Resources" is a cluster, grid, or other entity that provides compute cycles.  These are defined in a config file.
 * The user provides credentials and login information for each Resource.





== Structure ==

Just a quick idea for future structure.
